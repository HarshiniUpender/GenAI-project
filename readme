This project let's end user get suggestions from 'gpt-35-turbo' model about the right crop to grow in a particular place and ask questions to get relevant answers.

Both prompt engineering and RAG are implmented here, 

Using the UI end user can opt for a 'Generalised suggestion' by selecting 'Yes' radio button,
which using prompt engineering suggests the crops for a particular location. 


By selecting 'No' radio button, the text box gets enabled which lets end user to ask their questions and 
RAG implementation is done here,
I have generated embeddings using 'text-embedding-ada-002' model for a sample data that has details about different locations,
When the end user poses the question, an embedding is generated for that too and using cosine similarity
found the closed relative chunk from the sample data. Thereby deriving an apt answer and displaying back on the UI.

Also a target language can be selected by enduser, by which the model generates the responses in that specific language and same is displayed back on the UI.
